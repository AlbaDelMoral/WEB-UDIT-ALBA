              Bootstrap is a free, open-source tool that helps developers
              quickly build responsive, mobile-friendly websites. It includes
              ready-made components like buttons, forms, and navigation, plus a
              grid system and plugins, making it easier to create consistent and
              attractive designs.

              <br />
              <br /><br /><br />

              When I started looking into Bootstrap, I was surprised by how much
              it actually helps make web design easier. The feature that stood
              out to me the most was the grid system — it made organizing
              layouts so much simpler, especially when trying to make pages look
              good on both computers and phones. I also really liked the
              ready-made components like buttons, cards, and navbars because
              they saved me time and still looked clean and professional. As I
              explored the Bootstrap website, I noticed how well the
              documentation was written — everything had examples, and it felt
              easy to follow even for someone who’s still learning. Overall, I
              think Bootstrap is a great tool that makes designing websites more
              enjoyable and less stressful, especially when trying to create
              something that looks modern without having to code every detail
              from scratch.

              Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that helps
              developers style websites by applying small, reusable classes
              directly in the HTML. Instead of using pre-designed components, it
              gives full control over design, making it easy to create custom,
              responsive layouts quickly and consistently.

              <br />
              <br /><br /><br />

              After researching Tailwind CSS and looking through its official
              website, I was really interested in how different it is compared
              to other CSS frameworks. From what I saw, Tailwind focuses on
              giving developers complete control over their designs through
              small utility classes instead of pre-made components. I liked the
              idea that you can build your own unique style while still keeping
              everything neat and consistent. The website itself was very modern
              and easy to navigate, with clear examples showing how each class
              works and how quickly layouts can be customized. I also noticed
              that Tailwind places a big emphasis on responsive design and
              performance, which makes it appealing for modern web development.
              Overall, I think Tailwind offers a very flexible and creative
              approach to styling, especially for people who like to design
              everything from scratch rather than rely on preset templates.

              Material UI (MUI) is an open-source React component library that
              implements Google's Material Design system. It provides prebuilt,
              customizable components that allow developers to build user
              interfaces for web and mobile applications more quickly and
              efficiently by following Google's design guidelines, which ensure
              a consistent and modern user experience.
              <br />
              <br /><br /><br />

              When looking into Material UI, I was really impressed with the
              quality and beauty of their components. They showcase high
              standards of function and form, showing that they take into
              account aesthetics and functionality, which I liked. However this
              means that there is not a lot of variety in their designs since
              they follow Google's Material Design. Overall it has a lot of
              explanation, demos... in order to learn and implement their
              components. It is a good site, not too crazy about it.

              Shadcn/ui is a set of beautifully-designed, accessible components
              and a code distribution platform. Works with your favorite
              frameworks and AI models. Open Source. Open Code. This is not a
              component library. It is how you build your component library.

              <br />
              <br /><br /><br />

              After researching Shadcn UI, I found it to be a really interesting
              and modern approach to building user interfaces. What makes it
              stand out is that instead of installing a full library, you copy
              and paste React components directly into your project, which gives
              you full control over customization. The website looked very clean
              and well-organized, with examples showing how it combines Tailwind
              CSS and Radix primitives to create accessible and visually
              appealing designs. I liked how flexible it seemed and how it
              encourages developers to understand their code rather than rely on
              pre-built styles. However, I also noticed that it might be a bit
              technical for beginners, since it requires some knowledge of React
              and Tailwind to use effectively.

              When researching into Astro I noticed that it didn't have many
              options of using templates without paying. That is a con for me
              since I feel like templates are a nice and easy way for us to
              start learning a program. Despite that the templates look very
              professional and nicely designed which is good. In terms of its
              components, I didn't really understand what they were offering or
              where their components where, other programms have it better
              displayed. Overall Astro is probably not going to be a program I
              will be using.

              Hugo is a static site generator that builds fast, secure websites
              from content and templates. It creates all pages in advance,
              supports reusable themes, multilingual sites, and content
              organization, making it an efficient tool for professional
              websites without needing a database.

              <br />
              <br /><br /><br />

              On the contrary of Astro, HUGO does offer more free templates that
              we can download and demo, which is very much appreciated. However
              it is also a bit confusing to navigate in terms of installing
              components or what components it offers. Overall It is easier than
              Astro but feels more outaded.

              GSAP, or GreenSock Animation Platform, is a powerful JavaScript
              animation library that is used by web developers and designers to
              create interactive and engaging websites. GSAP is known for its
              versatility, speed, and ease of use, making it a popular choice
              among developers worldwide.
              <br />

              When I first researched GSAP I was surprised at its modern and
              vibrant feel. I like their website because cleraly shows what they
              are about and also in a catchy and attractive way, not like other
              websites that might feel too technical. When looking into how it
              works, at first I was a bit overwhelmed because animations seem
              very difficult to grasp, however even tho the code is a bit
              harder, the website really helps by explaining it nicely and in
              the most simple way. One thing I really enjoyed was the scroll
              animations, since they make the website feel more organic and
              interactive. I like the tutorials they have and overall seems a
              good tool for creating smooth animations that can make my website
              much more interesting.

              When talking about Framer i thought I was going to be dissapointed
              because had high expectations from GSAP, however they proved me
              wrong. Framer's website is even more intuitive and simpler, it
              goes spet by step on the implementation of its animations, it has
              real demostrations and tutorials. Despite all the information
              perfectly layed out, the code overwhelmed me more than in GSAP, i
              feel it is more difficult to understand since a lot of code is
              being present. I liked its animations and how effortles they look.
              While looking at GSAP I like better its scroll page animation, in
              Framer Motion i like better how they animate individual buttons or
              attributes.

              Flowbite is an open-source library of web components built with
              the utility-first classes from Tailwind CSS. It also includes
              interactive elements such as dropdowns, modals, datepickers.

              <br />
              <br /><br /><br />

              After looking through the Flowbite website, I found it to be a
              well-designed and useful resource for anyone working with Tailwind
              CSS. It offers a wide range of pre-built components like
              navigation bars, modals, and forms, which can save a lot of time
              when building websites. I liked how the site included interactive
              examples and clear documentation, making it easy to see how each
              component works. It seems great for rapid prototyping and creating
              consistent designs without starting from scratch. However, I also
              noticed that using Flowbite properly would require some knowledge
              of Tailwind, and customizing certain parts might be more limiting
              compared to designing everything manually. Overall, it looks like

              When researching Cruip, I was really impressed by how clean and
              modern their templates looked. The website showcases a mix of free
              and premium designs, which are built with technologies like React
              and Tailwind CSS. I liked that they offer both simple HTML
              versions for quick projects and React versions for more advanced
              ones. The templates are visually appealing and would be perfect
              for startups or landing pages that need a professional look right
              away. On the downside, some of the best templates are paid, and
              customization might take extra effort if you want something
              unique. Still, I think Cruip stands out for providing beautiful,
              ready-to-use designs that can help developers save time while
              maintaining a high-quality appearance.

              Hygraph is a headless content management system (CMS) that
              delivers content as data via API to any platform instead of being
              tightly coupled to a specific website, web app, or mobile app.

              After researching Tailwind CSS and looking through its official
              website, I was really interested in how different it is compared
              to other CSS frameworks. From what I saw, Tailwind focuses on
              giving developers complete control over their designs through
              small utility classes instead of pre-made components. I liked the
              idea that you can build your own unique style while still keeping
              everything neat and consistent. The website itself was very modern
              and easy to navigate, with clear examples showing how each class
              works and how quickly layouts can be customized. I also noticed
              that Tailwind places a big emphasis on responsive design and
              performance, which makes it appealing for modern web development.
              Overall, I think Tailwind offers a very flexible and creative
              approach to styling, especially for people who like to design
              everything from scratch rather than rely on preset templates.

          <hr class="img-separator" />
          <br /><br />
          Looking back on this project, I’ve learned a lot about how different
          web tools and frameworks work and how they fit into modern web design.
          My research helped me see how each program has its own strengths, but
          also how they often connect through the same systems, like Node.js. I
          found that Node.js made things easier by helping manage and install
          different tools, but at first, it was a bit confusing to understand
          how it all worked together. As I explored more sites and frameworks, I
          started to appreciate how much goes on behind the scenes to make
          websites run smoothly. This process taught me to be more patient and
          curious when learning new technologies, and it gave me a better
          understanding of the balance between creativity and the technical side
          of web design.
